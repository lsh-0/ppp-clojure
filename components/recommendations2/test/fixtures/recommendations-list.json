          "text" : "Akt is a Ser/Thr protein kinase that plays a central role in metabolism and cancer. Regulation of Akt’s activity involves an autoinhibitory intramolecular interaction between its pleckstrin homology (PH) domain and its kinase domain that can be relieved by C-tail phosphorylation. PH domain mutant E17K Akt is a well-established oncogene. Previously, we reported that the conformation of autoinhibited Akt may be shifted by small molecule allosteric inhibitors limiting the mechanistic insights from existing X-ray structures that have relied on such compounds (Chu et al., 2020). Here, we discover unexpectedly that a single mutation R86A Akt exhibits intensified autoinhibitory features with enhanced PH domain-kinase domain affinity. Structural and biochemical analysis uncovers the importance of a key interaction network involving Arg86, Glu17, and Tyr18 that controls Akt conformation and activity. Our studies also shed light on the molecular basis for E17K Akt activation as an oncogenic driver."

          "text" : "Electron-bifurcation is a fundamental energy conservation mechanism in nature in which two electrons from an intermediate potential electron donor are split so that one is sent along a high potential pathway to a high potential acceptor and the other is sent along a low potential pathway to a low potential acceptor. This process allows endergonic reactions to be driven by exergonic ones and is an alternative, less recognised, mechanism of energy coupling to the well-known chemiosmotic principle. The electron-bifurcating [FeFe] hydrogenase from <i>Thermotoga maritima</i> (HydABC) requires both NADH and ferredoxin to reduce protons generating hydrogen. The mechanism of electron-bifurcation in HydABC remains enigmatic in spite of intense research efforts over the last few years. Structural information may provide the basis for a better understanding of spectroscopic and functional information. Here, we present a 2.3 Å electron cryo-microscopy structure of HydABC. The structure shows a heterododecamer composed of two independent 'halves' each made of two strongly interacting HydABC heterotrimers connected via a [4Fe-4S] cluster. A central electron transfer pathway connects the active sites for NADH oxidation and for proton reduction. We identified two conformations of a flexible iron-sulfur cluster domain: a 'closed bridge' and an 'open bridge' conformation, where a Zn<sup>2+</sup> site may act as a 'hinge' allowing domain movement. Based on these structural revelations, we propose a possible mechanism of electron-bifurcation in HydABC where the flavin mononucleotide serves a dual role as both the electron bifurcation center and as the NAD<sup>+</sup> reduction/NADH oxidation site."

          "text" : "Bisphosphonate-related osteonecrosis of the jaw (BRONJ) presents as a morbid jawbone lesion in patients exposed to a nitrogen-containing bisphosphonate (N-BP). Although it is rare, BRONJ has caused apprehension among patients and healthcare providers and decreased acceptance of this anti-resorptive drug class to treat osteoporosis and metastatic osteolysis. We report here a novel method to elucidate the pathological mechanism of BRONJ by the selective removal of legacy N-BP from the jawbone using an intra-oral application of hydroxymethylene diphosphonate (HMDP) formulated in liposome-based deformable nanoscale vesicles (DNV). After maxillary tooth extraction, zoledronate-treated mice developed delayed gingival wound closure, delayed tooth extraction socket healing and increased jawbone osteonecrosis consistent with human BRONJ lesion. Single cell RNA sequencing of mouse gingival cells revealed oral barrier immune dysregulation and unresolved pro-inflammatory reaction. HMDP-DNV topical applications to nascent mouse BRONJ lesions resulted in accelerated gingival wound closure and bone socket healing as well as attenuation of osteonecrosis development. The gingival single cell RNA sequencing demonstrated resolution of chronic inflammation by increased anti-inflammatory signature gene expression of lymphocytes and myeloid-derived suppressor cells. This study suggests that BRONJ pathology is related to N-BP levels in jawbones and demonstrates the potential of HMDP-DNV as an effective BRONJ therapy."
