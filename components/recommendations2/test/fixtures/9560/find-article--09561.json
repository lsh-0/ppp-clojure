        "text" : "We describe the physical context of the Dinaledi Chamber within the Rising Star cave, South Africa, which contains the fossils of <i>Homo naledi</i>. Approximately 1550 specimens of hominin remains have been recovered from at least 15 individuals, representing a small portion of the total fossil content. Macro-vertebrate fossils are exclusively <i>H. naledi</i>, and occur within clay-rich sediments derived from in situ weathering, and exogenous clay and silt, which entered the chamber through fractures that prevented passage of coarser-grained material. The chamber was always in the dark zone, and not accessible to non-hominins. Bone taphonomy indicates that hominin individuals reached the chamber complete, with disarticulation occurring during/after deposition. Hominins accumulated over time as older laminated mudstone units and sediment along the cave floor were eroded. Preliminary evidence is consistent with deliberate body disposal in a single location, by a hominin species other than <i>Homo sapiens</i>, at an as-yet unknown date.",

In fact, the stratigraphic section of the site presented in the article consists of an unscaled schematic diagram.

It is situated in the central part of the system and was found during speleological surveys (see methodology section). The only identified access point into the Dinaledi Chamber involves an exposed, ∼15 m climb from the bottom of a large ante-chamber (the Dragon's Back Chamber), up the side of a sharp-edged dolomite block that has dislodged from the roof (the Dragon's Back; <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). From the top of the Dragon's Back, the Dinaledi Chamber is accessed via a narrow, northeast-oriented vertical fissure, and involves a ∼12 m vertical climb down, with squeezes as tight as ∼20 cm, to reach the floor (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B,C</a>). The main passage forming the Dinaledi Chamber is ∼25–50 cm wide at its narrowest and ∼10 m long, and expands in width near the intersections with cross-cutting passages (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>). The roof of both the Dinaledi and Dragon's Back chambers is formed by the capping chert (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). The Dragon's Back Chamber can currently be accessed in two ways, both involving steep climbs along narrow fractures and tight passages (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>): route 1, along an east-northeast trending passage that follows a fracture for a horizontal distance of ∼50 m past a narrow access point called the ‘postbox’; and route 2, along a more complicated set of broadly east-trending passages, via a network of southeast, east and north trending fractures for ∼120 m, and past a narrow access point called ‘superman crawl’. Route 1 is the most direct and contains abundant sediment accumulations once the deeper part of the cave is accessed (i.e., ∼20 m into the cave); route 2 has a gentler gradient, but is longer and involves a descent along narrow fissures largely devoid of sediment accumulations. An exhaustive search by a professional caving team and researchers has failed to find any other plausible access points into the Dinaledi Chamber, and there is no evidence to suggest that an older, now sealed, entrance to the chamber ever existed. Furthermore, detailed surface mapping of the landscape overlying the Rising Star cave system (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>) illustrates that no large flowstone-filled fractures occur in the region above the Dinaledi Chamber.",

We interpret the observed weathering patterns to result from fluctuations in moisture content in the Dinaledi Chamber, causing swelling and shrinkage of the osseous material, with larger longitudinal cracking being caused by sediment loading. As bone is repeatedly exposed to wet and dry conditions in seasonally/periodically wet environments, crack formation may be enhanced by the shrinking and swelling of the material (<a href=\"#bib38\">Junod and Pokines, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Pokines and Symes, 2013</a>).

Examination of the entire fossil assemblage for fracture patterns indicates that all of the fractures in the <i>H. naledi</i> assemblage resulted from dry bone (or mechanically incompetent) breakage, with many bones displaying recent or weathering related (19%) breakage patterns (<a href=\"#bib73\">Villa and Mahieu, 1991</a>; <a href=\"#bib69\">Symes et al., 2013</a>). Significantly, no examples of spiral (green) fractures have been documented (<a href=\"#SD2-data\">Supplementary file 2</a>), which indicates that post-depositional processes are the primary agents of skeletal damage. Fracturing has led to disassociation and spatial dispersal of many of the skeletal elements (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figures 6,7</a>). Refitting fragments of bone indicates that breakage occurred at different times in the depositional history of the assemblage. For some elements, neighbouring bone fragments display unique patterns of weathering and surface modification (e.g., <a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10H</a>); that is, breakage occurred relatively early in the depositional history and preceded periods of surface exposure. In other instances separate fragments that can be refitted to display matching staining patterns (e.g., <a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10F</a>) indicating that breakage occurred relatively late in the weathering history; that is, after the element had been lying on surface long enough for mineral stains to be deposited. These patterns are consistent with the geological observation that sediment in Units 2 and 3 with fossil remains were affected by reworking, with some bone material being re-deposited several times. We, therefore, interpret the observed dry-bone fracture patterns to be due to post-depositional sediment movement within the chamber as Units 2 and 3 are reworked, as well as unintentional damage by cavers or others entering the chamber; and we find no evidence for green fractures associated with trauma in the <i>H. naledi</i> fossil assemblage.",

The cave has been inundated in the past by rising water tables, but there is no evidence within the Dinaledi Chamber of depositional processes that involved high-energy transport mechanisms capable of transporting the large hominin bones, let alone do so in a uniquely selective manner. The high abundance and diversity of predominantly non-hominin fossil remains preserved throughout the adjacent Dragon's Back Chamber not only refute sediment transport by water flow between the two chambers, but also indicates that a considerable barrier between the two chambers was in place at time of deposition of <i>H. naledi</i>, and indeed throughout the history of the Dinaledi Chamber. The Dinaledi Chamber has been a closed depositional system for a long time, and did not allow the sudden ingress of water and sediment; only fine-grained muddy sediment accumulated, which accessed the chamber through narrow cracks that filtered out coarser material. Thus, the accumulation of the hominin remains in the chamber does not fit the pattern of a flood or fluvial event (<a href=\"#bib8\">Behrensmeyer, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Dirks et al., 2010</a>).",

Despite abundant fossil material available for taphonomic study, we have, thus far, found no trace of carnivore damage on the Dinaledi remains. Nor have we found any trace of carnivore remains or the remains of other likely prey animals.

This could have happened either during a single event when a large number of hominin individuals were in the chamber, or in a death trap scenario over a period of time as individuals repeatedly entered the Dinaledi Chamber and died. Either scenario would have to explain why the animals chose to penetrate this deep into the cave, into the dark zone, moving away from all entrance points into the cave system. The sedimentological evidence presented suggests that accumulation of the fossils occurred over a period of time during deposition and reworking of Units 2, and 3, which refutes a single event hypothesis. Apart from this, and noting that the assemblage recovered to date represents only a small part of the total fossil content in the chamber, the sheer number of remains encountered in the Dinaledi Chamber, is hard to explain as the result of a single calamity. The individual entry hypothesis would require individuals or small groups to enter repeatedly and succumb to some form of, as yet unidentified, mortality event.

For example, attritional mortality tends to over-represent old adults and very young children in comparison to their proportions within a living population, while the age-at-death distribution resulting from a catastrophic event tends to be representative of the age structure in a living population with more young adults and older juveniles than the attritional profile. The mortality profiles of the Sima de los Huesos and Krapina hominin samples have been argued as consistent with a catastrophic profile using statistical tests (<a href=\"#bib12\">Bocquet-Appel and Arsuaga, 1999</a>). Most of the information to distinguish catastrophic from attritional age profiles in an age-at-death distribution is contained in the proportion of older juveniles and sub-adults. In both the Krapina and Sima de los Huesos assemblages, sample sizes are small and near the numerical limit to test statistically. In the Dinaledi assemblage, we presently can assess the age class (and, therefore, the approximate age-at-death distribution) for only 13 individuals, with 3 infants, 3 young juveniles, 1 old juvenile, 1 sub-adult, 4 young adults and 1 old adult (two additional individuals are represented by isolated teeth that cannot be attributed to an age class) (<a href=\"#bib11\">Berger et al., 2015</a>). We found no significant result when comparing the currently available distribution to either catastrophic or attritional mortality profiles, and therefore a mass death scenario involving some sort of calamity or death trap cannot be completely excluded to explain the Dinaledi assemblage. The large number of immature individuals (8 out of 13) does allow us to reject hypotheses that would strongly over-represent adults, such as repeated cave exploration by socially isolated adult males.

None of the bone elements studied shows evidence of green fracture (<a href=\"#SD2-data\">Supplementary file 2</a>), indicating lack of trauma. Therefore, if bodies were dropped down the entrance, it is unlikely that they would have fallen rapidly, or landed with any force; perhaps because the entry is too irregular and narrow to allow a body to freefall and gain speed, or perhaps because a pile of soft muddy sediment had accumulated below the entry way, breaking the momentum of any falling object. Note that accessing the entry point to the chamber to drop bodies down the chute would have still entailed a complex climb in the dark zone. In this scenario, the distribution of skeletal material, as well as the evidence for partial articulation, could be explained by the slow slumping of fleshed or semi-fleshed remains, downslope into the chamber. Alternatively, the hominins could have entered the chamber directly, carrying the bodies or dying there, which would explain, not only the absence of green fractures, but the presence of delicate, articulated remains in the excavation pit, deep in the chamber, well away from the entrance point, on the other side of floor drains.",
