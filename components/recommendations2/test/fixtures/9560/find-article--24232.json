        "text" : "The Rising Star cave system has produced abundant fossil hominin remains within the Dinaledi Chamber, representing a minimum of 15 individuals attributed to <i>Homo naledi</i>. Further exploration led to the discovery of hominin material, now comprising 131 hominin specimens, within a second chamber, the Lesedi Chamber. The Lesedi Chamber is far separated from the Dinaledi Chamber within the Rising Star cave system, and represents a second depositional context for hominin remains. In each of three collection areas within the Lesedi Chamber, diagnostic skeletal material allows a clear attribution to <i>H. naledi</i>. Both adult and immature material is present. The hominin remains represent at least three individuals based upon duplication of elements, but more individuals are likely present based upon the spatial context. The most significant specimen is the near-complete cranium of a large individual, designated LES1, with an endocranial volume of approximately 610 ml and associated postcranial remains. The Lesedi Chamber skeletal sample extends our knowledge of the morphology and variation of <i>H. naledi</i>, and evidence of <i>H. naledi</i> from both recovery localities shows a consistent pattern of differentiation from other hominin species.",

Found deep underground in the Dinaledi Chamber, the <i>H. naledi</i> fossils are the largest collection of a single species of an ancient human-relative discovered in Africa.",

Possible explanations such as <i>H. naledi</i> living in the cave or being washed in by a flood were considered but ruled out. Instead, the evidence was largely consistent with intact bodies being deliberately disposed of in the cave and then decomposing.",

The chamber is 30 meters below the surface and there is no direct route between it and the Dinaledi Chamber. Again, the evidence is most consistent with the bodies arriving intact into the chamber, and there were no signs that the remains had been exposed to the surface environment.",

I do think that it would be helpful if they included taphonomic observations of the individual hominin specimens. I know that the overall taphonomy of the hominin bones are discussed in an accompanying paper by Elliott et al., but perhaps it would make sense for the authors to include it here in more detail on a bone-by-bone basis. It is hard to tell from pictures, but it does appear that some of the specimens may be weathered, for example, the mandibular fragment shown in <a href=\"#fig21\">Figure 21</a> and many limb elements appear to have damaged or missing epiphyses. There hasn't been much done on weathering patterns in caves, but generally speaking, weathering is associated with exposure. In a protected environment like a cave chamber, I would not expect much or any weathering at all. The authors attribute the breakages observed to sediment loading (was the cave filled with sediments at one point?), inadvertent human activity, and matrix effects (from the accompanying paper by Elliott et al.). But I am not sure that the damage seen on the epiphyses (<a href=\"#fig15\">Figures 15</a>–<a href=\"#fig18\">18</a>) is consistent with those factors. With weathering on the bone, it would suggest some exposure to sun, wind, and other abrasion agents.

Part of this confusion arises from the fact that the authors never really say why they decided to pick those three particular parts of the chamber as they did, nor how much estimated deposit (hominin-bearing or otherwise) might remain. I am sure this will be of great interest to most readers, as the authors seem to imply that more skeletal material from these same individuals may be recovered in the future.",

I know that this was transferred from the Lesedi geology paper, but the authors do not present \"evidence for slumping and reworking of the sediments above the hominin layers\" and claim there is a \"lack of clear stratigraphic association\", but do not present information on the stratigraphic association (or stratigraphy period) to determine if the interpretation is supported by evidence. In short, what precludes the hominid material from being deposited by the same method (and therefore associated) as the other faunal remains? Similarly, if the immature hominin remains in 102b could be the result of slumping from around 102a (in Discussion), why couldn't the same situation be ascribed to the other fauna, arguing for the exact same pattern of deposition (and possible association). I would suggest that the entire paragraph be removed except for the first sentence, which could be added to the first paragraph of the \"Faunal material\" and include these issues of association with the \"ongoing\" research to be addressed later.

The fact that there aren't more elements must suggest that there was some post-depositional disturbance. Otherwise, where are they? The authors suggest that the hominin deposit was much more extensive at one point (960-961), the natural question to that is, what happened? What post-depositional process occurred to substantially decrease the hominin material?

I recommend either softening these assertions or giving additional weight to other possibilities. For example, they mention that there are \"differences in preservation\" of faunal and hominin remains but do not specify what those are. The fact that all faunal remains are all carnivores, indeed, suggests that perhaps small carnivores entered the cave system, became disoriented, and ended up in the chamber because they were following the scent of decomposing tissue. Without comparisons via direct radiometric or relative ages/geochemical signatures on the faunal and hominin remains, this section must remain more speculative than is made out to be.

Besides taphonomic details, in the revised version of their manuscript, Hawks et al provide extensive tables comparing cranial, mandibular and dental characters of the Lesedi fossils with those previously attributed to <i>H. naledi</i> as well as other hominin species. The authors now also incorporated a comparative figure (their <a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10</a>) the LES1 skull with selected hominins in lateral view. Although I applaud these incorporations, I still miss comparisons of the rest of the fossils. Claims are made that <i>H. naledi</i> (including the Lesedi material) is clearly distinct from previously recognized hominin taxa, and that these distinctive morphologies are spread throughout the body. However, there are not comparative figures showing the distinct morphology alongside other hominins. To be fair, the existing postcranial material of early <i>Homo</i> is very scant (and some not attributed to any specific taxon), and it would be very difficult to make the case that <i>H. naledi</i> is really distinct based on its postcrania. Thus, I would appreciate it if the authors made the effort to recognize this limitation (at the moment there is no way to really tell whether or not <i>H. naledi</i> is just a late <i>H. habilis</i>).

If it is the latter case, the null hypothesis is that this analysis will show how distinct these specimens are, rather than to which other taxa they resemble. More importantly, even for the case of the wrist bones (supposedly very distinct), they are not morphological comparisons with other fossils (the same applies for all the other postcranial and dental material). Why are the authors hesitant to show morphological comparisons with other hominin materials? Again, the readers should be able to evaluate the distinctiveness of the new fossils by themselves.

In the case of the Dinaledi tooth samples, the direct U-Th minimum ages are much lower than the dates as estimated by ESR. Proceeding with only the laser ablation U-Th approach would have yielded very misleading results. In our case we do not pursue any destructive sampling of material without an integrated plan for combination of methods, including biomolecule sampling in addition to stable isotope and radioisotope sampling. We hope that this process maximizes information and confidence in the end results, and it is also consistent with our understanding of the heritage regulations that apply to this work.",

We have also included 2 new figures (34 and 35) that present visual summaries of the anatomical evidence for similarity and difference with other species in a phylogenetic context for cranial and mandibular, and postcranial features, respectively.

We think the new figures strike an appropriate balance of illustrating well-known fossils, for which many researchers have casts in their reference or teaching collections, in combination with fossils from both the Dinaledi and Lesedi Chamber assemblages. We have prioritized including comparative images of Dmanisi specimens as these have previously been compared to the cranial and mandibular anatomy of <i>H. naledi</i>, and these specimens are not part of most researchers’ cast collections.

However, these skulls contrast strongly in other features. <i>H. erectus</i> is highly variable in size, as illustrated here by D2282 from Dmanisi, Georgia, one of the smallest and earliest <i>H. erectus</i> crania, and the L2 cranium from Zhoukoudian, China, one of the largest and latest <i>H. erectus</i> specimens. The relatively early KNM-ER 3733 has a size and endocranial volume close to the mean for <i>H. erectus</i>. Cranial remains that are attributed to <i>H. erectus</i> share a combination of anatomical features despite their diversity in size. Many such features of <i>H. erectus</i> are also shared with <i>H. naledi</i>, <i>H. habilis</i>, or <i>Au. sediba</i>, and notably, the differences in the frontal and vault between KNM-ER 1813 (<i>H. habilis</i>) and KNM-ER 1470 (<i>H. rudolfensis</i>) are mostly features that the smaller KNM-ER 1813 shares with <i>H. naledi</i>, <i>H. erectus</i>, and <i>Au. sediba</i>. The <i>H. naledi</i> skulls share some aspects of frontal morphology with <i>Au. sediba</i>, <i>H. habilis</i> and <i>H. erectus</i> that are not found in <i>Au. africanus</i> or <i>H. rudolfensis</i>, including frontal bossing and a supratoral sulcus. Two additional traits of the <i>H. naledi</i> anterior vault are shared with <i>Au. sediba</i> and <i>H. erectus</i>:slight postorbital construction and a posterior position of the temporal crest on the supraorbital torus. More posteriorly on the vault, <i>H. naledi</i> further shares an angular torus with <i>H. erectus</i>, and some individuals also have sagittal keeling. Both of these traits are also present in some archaic humans. Some <i>H. naledi</i> crania, such as DH3, are substantially smaller than any <i>H. erectus</i> cranium, and the small size and thin vault bone of even the largest <i>H. naledi</i> skull, LES1, are outliers compared to <i>H. erectus</i>, matched only by some Dmanisi crania. The facial morphology of <i>H. naledi</i> is more distinct from those of <i>H. erectus</i> and <i>H. habilis</i>. The nasal bones of LES1 do not project markedly anteriorly, although like many specimens of <i>H. erectus</i>, LES1 has a projecting nasal spine. LES1 has a relatively flat lower face, with a transversely concave clivus and incisors that project only slightly past the canines. This morphology is similar but less extreme than that found in KNM-ER 1470 of <i>H. rudolfensis</i>, and is not shared with the other species pictured here. <i>H. naledi</i> has several distinctive features of the temporal bone that are absent from or found in only a few specimens of the other species pictured, including a laterally inflated mastoid process (comparable to some specimens of <i>Au. afarensis</i>), a weak or absent crista petrosa (comparable to <i>Au. afarensis</i>), and a small external auditory meatus (comparable to KNM-WT 40000 of <i>Kenyanthropus platyops</i> [<a href=\"#bib63\">Leakey et al., 2001</a>]).

All mandibles are aligned using the line marking the distal edge of the first molar. Each of the six horizontal lines corresponds to the edges of teeth in the DH1 mandible, the holotype specimen of <i>H. naledi</i>, with corresponding teeth labeled to the left. Using these lines, it is apparent which specimens have longer premolars and first molars, and which have longer second and third molars compared to DH1. The dentition of the LES1 mandible has been affected by interproximal wear, resulting in shorter mesiodistal measurements. Mandibular morphology and dental proportions vary slightly among most species of <i>Homo</i>, particularly in comparison with the large differences in dental proportions among species of <i>Australopithecus</i> and <i>Paranthropus</i>. Still, <i>H. naledi</i> is clearly distinguishable from other species of <i>Homo</i> (<a href=\"#bib10\">Berger et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib61\">Laird et al., 2017</a>). Fossils of <i>H. rudolfensis</i>, <i>H. habilis</i>, and <i>H. erectus</i> differ from <i>H. naledi</i> in the proportions of different parts of the postcanine tooth row and in features of the mandibular corpus. <b><i>H. erectus</i>.</b> While fossils attributed to <i>H. erectus</i> vary in dental proportions, the early African and Georgian fossil specimens (here represented by KNM-ER 992, D211 and D2600) have larger first molars than <i>H. naledi</i>, comparable premolar sizes, and highly variable second and third molar sizes. The mandibles attributed to <i>H. erectus</i> mostly have greater corpus height than <i>H. naledi</i> mandibles and are highly diverse in corpus breadth, symphyseal thickness, and robusticity. Many have a strong post-incisive planum, most obvious in D2600 (shown). All three also differ from <i>H. naledi</i> in the crown complexity of their molars and premolar morphology, as illustrated in more detail in <a href=\"#fig12\">Figure 12</a>. Some specialists would attribute these three mandibles of <i>H. erectus</i> to three different species. <b><i>H. habilis</i>.</b> The two Olduvai mandibles of <i>H. habilis</i> are themselves quite different from each other in size. Both have similar dental proportions to <i>H. naledi</i> with bigger teeth across the postcanine dentition. <a href=\"#bib106\">Tobias (1967)</a> viewed O.H. 13 as being similar to <i>H. erectus</i> and described it as an ‘evolved <i>H. habilis</i>’. Its occlusal morphology and dental proportions do resemble KNM-ER 992 (<a href=\"#bib123\">Wood, 1991</a>), although the mandibular corpus is thinner and shallower, with a curved base in lateral profile. A strong post-incisive planum is evident in both mandibles. <b><i>H. rudolfensis</i>.</b> The KNM-ER 1802 and Uraha (UR 501) mandibles have often been attributed to <i>H. rudolfensis</i>, although both attributions may be doubtful (<a href=\"#bib64\">Leakey et al., 2012</a>). However, both lack any special similarities with contemporary australopiths and represent a megadont early <i>Homo</i> morphology with corpus size and robusticity much greater than those of <i>H. naledi</i>. <b><i>Au. sediba</i>.</b> Molar sizes in the MH2 mandible are around 1 mm larger than the average for <i>H. naledi</i>, but the proportions are very similar to those of <i>H. naledi</i>, and like <i>H. naledi</i>, MH2 has a weak post-incisive planum and a small symphysis area. <b><i>H. sapiens. </i></b>The modern human mandible shown here, from a recent South African individual, has similar first molar size to the <i>H. naledi</i> mandibles, but much smaller premolars and second and third molars. The crown complexity in this individual, which is not unusual for African population samples, is substantially greater than evidenced in <i>H. naledi</i>. The mandibular corpus is smaller and much less robust than <i>H. naledi</i>. KNM-ER 1802, UR 501, O.H. 13, O.H. 7, and KNM-ER 992 are illustrated here with casts; the remainder are original specimens. The left side of O.H. 7 is shown here mirrored.",

Here that variability is illustrated with two modern human mandibles of male individuals, one from island Melanesia (left), and one from southern Africa (right). <i>H. erectus</i> exhibits very extensive variation in corpus height and thickness. D2600 (shown) is extremely thick and robust, but is not an outlier; other <i>H. erectus</i> mandibles approach or equal its corpus dimensions. The position of the mental foramen also varies, as does the relative anterior versus posterior corpus height and the symphyseal profile, from more sloping to near vertical (as illustrated by KNM-ER 992, although this specimen is damaged at the symphysis).

The dental morphology of LES1 is entirely consistent with the Dinaledi sample of <i>H. naledi</i> (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figures 10</a> and <a href=\"#fig12\">12</a>). The mesiodistal and buccolingual (or labiolingual) crown dimensions of all the LES1 teeth fall within the range of the Dinaledi dental sample, except for those teeth where interproximal wear has clearly reduced the mesiodistal dimension (<a href=\"#tbl2\">Table 2</a>; <a href=\"#fig13\">Figure 13</a>). The P<sub>3</sub> crowns are worn, but they are roughly symmetrical about their mesiodistal axis in occlusal view; they are fully bicuspid and multirooted, with a smaller circular mesiobuccal root and larger, more platelike, distal root. This configuration is repeated throughout the Dinaledi dental assemblage. The shared overall P<sub>3</sub> morphology of LES1 and the Dinaledi sample is distinctive in <i>H. naledi</i> and not observed in other species of hominins (<a href=\"#fig12\">Figure 12</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Berger et al., 2015</a>). The P<sub>3</sub> and P<sub>4</sub> are both three-rooted, with two ovoid roots present buccally and a larger ovoid root present lingually. The roots are not widely splayed as in some other multi-rooted hominins, and especially for the P<sub>4</sub>, the buccal roots are closely packed in buccal view. This root configuration is seen in the <i>H. naledi</i> type specimen, U.W. 101–1277. The mandibular canine crowns have asymmetrically placed crown shoulders, with the mesial more apically placed than the distal. Further, the distal shoulder is formed by an accessory cuspule. These features are strongly distinctive in <i>H. naledi</i> (<a href=\"#bib10\">Berger et al., 2015</a>), with only a few specimens of <i>H. erectus</i> approaching this canine configuration. None of the molars exhibit any evidence of supernumerary cusps, and cingular features, such as the protostylid and Carabelli’s feature, are either absent or weakly developed and are expressed independently of the grooves of the crown. The molar size gradient in the LES1 mandible is M<sub>1</sub> &lt; M<sub>2</sub> &lt; M<sub>3</sub> as in the Dinaledi Chamber sample of <i>H. naledi</i> (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10</a>). The Dinaledi Chamber includes no maxillary dentition with all three molars in place, but U.W. 101–1269 is a LM<sub>3</sub> that exhibits a mesial interproximal facet that matches the distal facet of the LM<sub>2</sub> present in the U.W. 101–1277 (DH1) maxilla. If these specimens do represent a single individual, then the maxillary molar gradient for this specimen would be M<sub>1</sub> &lt; M<sub>3</sub> &lt; M<sub>2</sub>, which is also seen in the LES1 maxilla. In total, these dental features are within the known range for <i>H. naledi</i> in every instance and distinguish LES1 clearly from all other hominin species.",

The mandibles illustrated from <i>H. erectus</i> have relatively little occlusal wear, so their morphology can be seen more clearly than that of worn mandibles. The immature U.W. 101–377 (<i>H. naledi</i>) is comparable in developmental age and wear to O.H. 7 (<i>H. habilis</i>), as well as to D2735 and KNM-WT 15000 (<i>H. erectus</i>). When compared to <i>H. habilis</i>, <i>H. erectus</i>, and australopiths, <i>H. naledi</i> is notable for its relatively small first molars, its relatively small canines, and its lack of supernumerary cusps and crenulation on the molars. The complexity of molar cusp and groove patterns is especially evident in the chronologically early <i>H. erectus</i> specimens from Africa and Georgia shown here. For example, the unworn M<sub>2</sub> of the immature U.W. 101–377 mandible of <i>H. naledi</i> has a relatively simple crown anatomy with very little wrinkling or crenulation. By comparison, the M<sub>2</sub> of D2735, D211, and KNM-WT 15000, all with minimal occlusal wear, show extensive crenulation and supernumerary cusps. Canine size and molar crown complexity vary substantially among modern human populations, but the southern African individual illustrated on the right is not atypical for its population, and has greater molar crown complexity and larger canine dimensions than any of the <i>H. naledi</i> mandibular dentitions. The morphology of the third premolar varies extensively among these hominin species and within <i>H. erectus</i>. The <i>H. naledi</i> P<sub>3</sub> anatomy can be seen clearly in the immature U.W. 101–377 individual. It is characterized by roughly equally prominent lingual and buccal cusps and an expanded talonid. In <i>H. naledi</i>, this tooth is broadly similar in morphology and size to the P<sub>4</sub>. This configuration of the P<sub>3</sub> is not present in the other species, with only KNM-WT 15000 exhibiting some expansion of the lingual cusp in what remains an asymmetrical and rounded P<sub>3</sub>.

These shape similarities do not reflect small size alone: for example, <i>H. naledi</i> cranial material is quite distinct in shape from LB1, and the small DH3 calvaria of <i>H. naledi</i> is also notably different from KNM-ER 42700 in shape analyses (<a href=\"#bib95\">Schroeder et al., 2017</a>).

By contrast, U.W. 102a-003 has a steep medial aspect to the lesser trochanter, and it tails into a sharply defined crest that broadens around 15 mm down the shaft into a rugose, double crest, which narrows by midshaft into a strong linea aspera. The insertion for <i>m. gluteus maximus</i> is prominent and rugose in both femora but in U.W. 102a-001, the rugosity extends further down the shaft.

The Dinaledi remains of <i>H. naledi</i> have markedly anteverted femoral necks. Damage to the femoral neck of the U.W. 102a-001 specimen limits the accuracy of an estimate of anteversion, but at 115 degrees, this estimate is within the range for the Dinaledi specimens. The most distinctive feature of the <i>H. naledi</i> proximal femur is the presence of two mediolaterally oriented pillars on the superior femur neck, separated by a medially positioned shallow and vascularized groove where <i>m. obturator internus</i> and <i>gemelli</i> insert (<a href=\"#bib71\">Marchi et al., 2017</a>). This configuration is not seen in other hominin species. The U.W. 102a-001 femoral neck is damaged superiorly, precluding a clear assessment of whether two distinct pillars were present.

Two vertebrae (U.W. 102a-154a and U.W. 102a-154b) were in articulation in situ. The articular morphology and sizes of seven vertebrae suggest strongly that they represent a single individual; the remainder of these elements were recovered in close physical proximity but not in articulation. All fragments attributed to the LES1 cranium were likewise recovered from a small area. The hand and wrist material is consistent with a single right hand on the basis of articular morphology.

However, they are different in muscle attachments and diaphyseal morphology, to the extent that would represent unusual asymmetry in a single individual. The data do not allow us to discard the hypothesis that one of the femora represents a second adult individual in 102a, albeit an individual of similar body size. The descriptive and measurement data do not indicate which (if either) of these femora may belong to the individual represented by LES1, nor which (if any) of the other postcranial elements are associated with either femur. On the basis of the non-duplication of elements, it seems likely that if there is a second individual, this second individual is represented by only a small number of elements, possibly just the femur. The two humerus specimens, U.W. 102a-002 and U.W. 102a-257, differ slightly in shaft diameter where it can be compared, but no other morphological differences are apparent on the preserved fragments, and a slight degree of upper limb asymmetry is not unusual in humans or in fossil <i>Homo</i>.

However, the presence of material in three spatially separated localities within the chamber leads us to hypothesize that the current collection more probably represents additional individuals. The adult mandibular fragment in 102c is separated from the adult femora in 102a by more than 10 m, and the presence of this fragment in 102c, with an opening 1.3 m above the present cave floor, suggests that the sedimentary deposits may once have been much more voluminous. In light of the situation, we view it as likely that the 102c mandibular fragment represents an additional adult individual beyond what may be two individuals in 102a. The 102b deposit is separated by less distance from 102a, and the data do not yet provide a clear answer as to whether or not the juvenile remains in both areas could represent a single individual. Considering the spatial context, we hypothesize that four individuals may be represented: two adults and one immature individual in 102a and 102b; and one adult in 102c.

The pattern of shared morphological characters among these species and <i>H. naledi</i> is complex, and there is no consistent anatomical grouping of the characters shared with any given species. <i>H. naledi</i> shares more characters with <i>H. erectus</i> and <i>H. habilis</i> than with other species, and behind them, with <i>Au. sediba</i> and archaic and modern humans. <i>H. erectus</i> is variable for a large number of traits also found in <i>H. naledi</i>. The fact that variability is noted in <i>H. erectus</i>, Neandertals and modern humans for these traits is partially a function of the large samples available for these groups. It is probable that a larger sample of other species would likewise encompass greater variability. Any phylogenetic tree of these species would reveal a high degree of homoplasy for these cranial and mandibular traits.",

No derived features of the <i>H. naledi</i> skeleton require a close or exclusive relationship with modern humans. Overall, <i>H. naledi</i> resembles more primitive species of <i>Homo</i> such as <i>H. erectus, H. habilis,</i> or <i>H. rudolfensis</i> much more than it resembles archaic or modern humans (<a href=\"#bib10\">Berger et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib61\">Laird et al., 2017</a>; <a href=\"#bib71\">Marchi et al., 2017</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Feuerriegel et al., 2017</a>; <a href=\"#bib119\">Williams et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib95\">Schroeder et al., 2017</a>). <i>H. naledi</i> does, however, possess a number of derived features that are otherwise known only from modern humans and Neandertals (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1</a>; <a href=\"#fig34\">Figures 34</a> and <a href=\"#fig35\">35</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Berger et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Dembo et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Kivell et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Harcourt-Smith et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib119\">Williams et al., 2016</a>).

All crania are oriented as near as possible to the Frankfort plane, delineated by the light gray lines in the background of the figure. Compared to other hominin genera, including <i>Australopithecus</i> and <i>Paranthropus</i>, fossil <i>Homo</i> is often recognized by cranial and dental features such as a more vertical face profile, a reduced postcanine dentition, larger endocranial volume, a higher frontal, and a true supraorbital torus. <i>Au. africanus</i> (Sts 5, top left) represents the ancestral hominin condition lacking these traits. The other crania in the top two rows vary substantially in these features. LB1 has a vertical face, reduced dentition, and high, rounded frontal, but has comparatively small endocranial volume. KNM-ER 1470 has a large volume, a high frontal, and a more vertical face profile, but also is inferred to have a large postcanine dentition and has no true supraorbital torus. MH1 (<i>Au. sediba</i>) has a small volume, but shares features with <i>Homo</i> that include the less sloping face profile, a supraorbital torus, and reduced postcanine dentition. O.H. 24 has a low, sloping frontal, and a concave facial profile, but a true supraorbital torus and reduced postcanine teeth. This variability among species that are interpreted as ‘primitive’ <i>Homo</i>, such as <i>H. habilis</i> and <i>H. floresiensis</i>, and <i>Homo</i>-like australopiths makes it difficult to delineate the genus <i>Homo</i> (<a href=\"#bib122\">Wood and Collard, 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Dembo et al., 2016</a>). <i>H. erectus</i> is also highly variable. It includes several crania with endocranial volumes below 700 ml, including KNM-ER 42700 and D2282, but also many larger crania, here represented by Sangiran 17 and Zhoukoudian L2 (ZKD L2). Specimens attributed to <i>H. erectus</i> tend to share a series of traits first noted in Asian <i>H. erectus</i> samples, including a long, low cranial profile, thick cranial bone, sagittal keeling, prominent supraorbital, angular, and occipital tori, a sharply angled occiput, and a postbregmatic depression. The smallest <i>H. erectus</i> crania share most of these features, with a low cranial profile, angled occiput and postbregmatic depression visible here in D2282. But these features do vary substantially and are less evident in the immature KNM-ER 42700. The <i>H. naledi</i> crania are similar to KNM-ER 1470 in having a transversely flat clivus contour, but all are smaller, with a much smaller palate and with very different frontal morphology. Like O.H. 24 and KNM-ER 1813, the <i>H. naledi</i> crania have relatively thin cranial bone and a thin and projecting supraorbital torus. But <i>H. naledi</i> manifests a different clivus shape, a projecting nasal spine, a greater cranial height, sagittal keeling and an angular torus. The <i>H. naledi</i> crania bear little resemblance to LB1, differing in face profile, size, and their larger postcanine dentitions. Known African <i>Homo</i> specimens from the later Middle Pleistocene other than <i>H. naledi</i>, such as the Kabwe skull (pictured), contrast strongly with <i>H. naledi</i> in cranial size and morphology. The Omo 2 skull, one of the earliest known modern human crania at approximately 196,000 years (<a href=\"#bib73\">McDougall et al., 2005</a>), is vastly larger and very different from any <i>H. naledi</i> specimen, despite being near the same geological age.

Skeletal remains of <i>H. floresiensis</i> are known from ~100–60-ka-old sediments at Liang Bua, Flores (<a href=\"#bib17\">Brown et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib100\">Sutikna et al., 2016</a>), and possibly also in Mata Menge, Flores sediments from the early Middle Pleistocene (<a href=\"#bib111\">van den Bergh et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Brumm et al., 2016</a>). The features shared by <i>H. naledi</i> and <i>H. floresiensis</i> are nearly all inferred to be primitive features shared with australopiths and/or in some cases with early <i>Homo</i> (<a href=\"#fig35\">Figures 35</a> and <a href=\"#fig36\">36</a>). For most features of the skeleton where <i>H. naledi</i> exhibits derived morphology, including aspects of the foot and hand, <i>H. floresiensis</i> exhibits morphology thought to be primitive within hominins (<a href=\"#bib44\">Harcourt-Smith et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Kivell et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib109\">Tocheri et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Jungers et al., 2009a</a>; <a href=\"#bib80\">Orr et al., 2013</a>). All known <i>H. floresiensis</i> long bones are small, reflecting small stature and mass (<a href=\"#bib50\">Jungers et al., 2009b</a>; <a href=\"#bib62\">Larson et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Grabowski et al., 2015</a>), and none approach the much larger size, particularly the taller stature, manifested in adult specimens of <i>H. naledi</i>. The mandibles of <i>H. floresiensis</i> are relatively robust, even for their small size,(<a href=\"#bib16\">Brown and Maeda, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Daegling et al., 2014</a>) and in this sense, are comparable to the robust mandibles of <i>H. naledi</i>, though the two species differ in symphyseal morphology (<a href=\"#bib61\">Laird et al., 2017</a>). The dentition of <i>H. floresiensis</i> displays a unique combination of primitive and derived characters (<a href=\"#bib53\">Kaifu et al., 2015</a>), which are different from the combination found in <i>H. naledi. Homo floresiensis</i> canines and premolars display a combination of features that are primitive for hominins (<a href=\"#bib53\">Kaifu et al., 2015</a>), while <i>H. naledi</i> mandibular canines and third premolars have a uniquely derived form. The <i>H. floresiensis</i> molars exhibit derived proportions and some other features similar to those of modern humans, which may reflect the extremely shortened molar crowns, particularly of the first molars (<a href=\"#bib53\">Kaifu et al., 2015</a>). By contrast, <i>H. naledi</i> has primitive proportions of the molars and occlusal morphology that is broadly primitive within <i>Homo,</i> although simplified in complexity. Shape analyses also place the cranium of <i>H. floresiensis</i> (LB1) far from any <i>H. naledi</i> cranial specimen (<a href=\"#bib95\">Schroeder et al., 2017</a>). These differences in anatomy may reflect a distant phylogenetic relationship between the two species, although these data do not clearly resolve where on the <i>Homo</i> phylogeny either species should be placed. Some phylogenetic evidence suggests that the <i>H. floresiensis</i> branch preceded the node linking <i>H. erectus</i> and modern humans (<a href=\"#bib3\">Argue et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Dembo et al., 2015</a>).

No data that are available at present answer whether either or both of these lineages may have retained small EVC from an ancestry among the earliest members of <i>Homo</i>, or whether their smaller brain sizes may have evolved secondarily from larger-brained ancestors. Together, they establish that diverse hominin lineages with varying brain and body sizes existed during the Middle Pleistocene, suggesting the influence of ecological factors that promoted diversity during the Pleistocene evolution of humans and great apes (<a href=\"#bib11\">Berger et al., 2017</a>; <a href=\"#bib110\">Tocheri et al., 2011</a>, <a href=\"#bib108\">2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Dunn et al., 2014</a>).",

To the extent that the <i>H. naledi</i> postcranial skeleton is different from material attributed to <i>H. erectus</i>, it is mostly because <i>H. naledi</i> manifests primitive traits that are not otherwise seen in <i>Homo</i>, or because <i>H. naledi</i> manifests traits not otherwise seen in hominins (<a href=\"#fig35\">Figure 35</a>). <i>H. naledi</i> also shares several derived postcranial features with archaic and modern humans, but a lack of postcranial evidence for these parts of the <i>H. erectus</i> skeleton has made it impossible to determine whether <i>H. erectus</i> may also have shared these derived features (<a href=\"#fig35\">Figure 35</a>). With respect to the cranium and dentition, nearly all of the nonmetric traits shared by <i>H. naledi</i> and <i>H. erectus</i> are also shared with <i>Au. sediba</i>, <i>H. habilis</i>, or both (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1</a>; <a href=\"#fig34\">Figure 34</a>). <i>H. naledi</i> and <i>H. erectus</i> share at least three derived nonmetric features of the skull that are not also found in <i>Au. sediba</i> or <i>H. habilis</i>: an angular torus, sagittal keeling, and an anteriorly projecting nasal spine. But each of these three traits can also be found in some archaic or modern humans. <i>H. naledi</i> also possesses some cranial and dental traits not seen in any specimens of <i>H. erectus</i>; these include both primitive traits shared with <i>Au. afarensis</i>, <i>Au. africanus</i> or <i>Au. sediba</i> and derived traits shared either with <i>H. rudolfensis</i> or with archaic and modern humans. Even though <i>H. naledi</i> crania are most similar in shape to the smallest <i>H. erectus</i> crania from Dmanisi (<a href=\"#bib95\">Schroeder et al., 2017</a>), they are distinct from the Dmanisi sample in numerous aspects of cranial, dental, and postcranial morphology (<a href=\"#bib10\">Berger et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib61\">Laird et al., 2017</a>; <a href=\"#bib71\">Marchi et al., 2017</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Feuerriegel et al., 2017</a>; <a href=\"#bib92\">Rightmire et al., 2017</a>), and Bayesian analysis of cranial and dental morphology provides strong evidence against the hypothesis of a sister taxon relationship for these samples (<a href=\"#bib30\">Dembo et al., 2016</a>). In summary, no traits link <i>H. naledi</i> exclusively or specifically with <i>H. erectus</i>, and many traits distinguish the two. The evidence is not sufficient to say whether <i>H. naledi</i> may have evolved from an earlier population that resembled <i>H. erectus</i>, or whether earlier fossils representing the <i>H. naledi</i> lineage may already have been found and until now attributed to <i>H. erectus</i> (<a href=\"#bib11\">Berger et al., 2017</a>).",

Phylogenetic analysis does not reject the hypothesis of a sister taxon relationship between <i>H. naledi</i> and <i>Au. sediba</i> or <i>H. habilis</i> (<a href=\"#bib30\">Dembo et al., 2016</a>). However, in comparison to both <i>Au. sediba</i> and <i>H. habilis, H. naledi</i> is derived and similar to modern humans and Neandertals in several aspects of hand and wrist morphology (<a href=\"#bib57\">Kivell et al., 2015</a>).

Like the Dinaledi Chamber, the access route to the Lesedi Chamber is very restricted.

As a result, protocols followed those used in the Dinaledi Chamber (<a href=\"#bib33\">Dirks et al., 2015</a>), with a few exceptions. Specifically, attempts to use some of the surface-scanning methods applied in the Dinaledi Chamber (<a href=\"#bib58\">Kruger et al., 2016</a>) failed due to the limited working distances of the scanner, the convoluted surfaces, and the poor contrast of the surrounding dolomite. However, high-resolution laser scan data have been acquired for the Lesedi Chamber and will form the basis of future spatial work. Consequently, documentation of the excavations and provenience of the material was conducted using traditional archaeological methods, including written descriptions, photography and drawings.

These methods were similar to those performed on the previously published Dinaledi <i>H. naledi</i> crania (<a href=\"#bib10\">Berger et al., 2015</a>). The LES1 partial cranium was scanned using a NextEngine 3D Scanner and associated ScanStudio HD Pro software. Two 360-degree scans were collected using 16 divisions and 1000 dpi with the cranium in different orientations in order to capture the maximum ectocranial and endocranial surfaces. The two 360-degree scans were then merged and exported as a .ply file. The .ply file was opened in GeoMagic Studio, converted to a point cloud, and re-wrapped to minimize the number of edges in the model (created from the individual surface scans). The LES1 virtual model was then duplicated and mirrored, and the mirror-image (right portion) was aligned with the original model (left portion) using both the Manual and Global Registration functions. In doing this, the program uses an iterative process to find the greatest congruency between the region of overlap in the two models, minimizing deviations. Convergence was detected after 20 iterations, with an average deviation of 0.47 mm and a standard deviation of 0.43 mm. Some deviation is expected given the natural anatomical asymmetry and refitting of the fragments. A deviation map illustrates that areas with the highest deviation were fairly localized (<a href=\"#fig37\">Figure 37</a>).
