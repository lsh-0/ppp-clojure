We would also like to thank the many funding agencies that supported various aspects of this work. In particular we would like to thank the National Geographic Society, the National Research Foundation and the Lyda Hill Foundation for significant funding of the discovery, recovery and initial analysis of this material. Further support was provided by ARC (DP140104282: PHGMD, ER, JK, HHW; FT 120100399: AH). The ESR dosimetry study undertaken by CENIEH and Griffith University has been supported by a Marie Curie International Outgoing Fellowship (under REA Grant Agreement n° PIOF-GA-2013–626474) of the European Union's Seventh Framework Programme (FP7/2007-2013) and an Australian Research Council Future Fellowship (FT150100215). ESR and U-series dating undertaken at SCU were supported by ARC (DP140100919: RJB). We would also like to thank the University of the Witwatersrand, the Evolutionary Studies Institute and the South African National Centre of Excellence in PalaeoSciences for hosting many of the authors while studying the material, and allowing original material to be made available for dating. We would like to thank the South African Heritage Resource Agency for the necessary permits to work on the Rising Star site; the Jacobs family and later the Lee Berger Foundation for granting access. The assistance of members of the Speleological Exploration Club, in various safety aspects within the cave during excavations is gratefully acknowledged. Zenobia Jacobs and Bert Roberts of the University of Wollongong are thanked for helping with initial OSL tests for single grain analyses and for helpful discussions. We would also like to thank Wilma Lawrence, Bonita De Klerk, Natasha Barbolini, Merrill van der Walt, Wayne Crichton and Justin Mukanku for their assistance during all phases of the project. RG and MD thank Les Kinsley, ANU, for his invaluable help to keep the Neptune in tune.

        "text" : "New ages for flowstone, sediments and fossil bones from the Dinaledi Chamber are presented. We combined optically stimulated luminescence dating of sediments with U-Th and palaeomagnetic analyses of flowstones to establish that all sediments containing <i>Homo naledi</i> fossils can be allocated to a single stratigraphic entity (sub-unit 3b), interpreted to be deposited between 236 ka and 414 ka. This result has been confirmed independently by dating three <i>H. naledi</i> teeth with combined U-series and electron spin resonance (US-ESR) dating. Two dating scenarios for the fossils were tested by varying the assumed levels of <sup>222</sup>Rn loss in the encasing sediments: a maximum age scenario provides an average age for the two least altered fossil teeth of 253 +82/–70 ka, whilst a minimum age scenario yields an average age of 200 +70/–61 ka. We consider the maximum age scenario to more closely reflect conditions in the cave, and therefore, the true age of the fossils. By combining the US-ESR maximum age estimate obtained from the teeth, with the U-Th age for the oldest flowstone overlying <i>Homo naledi</i> fossils, we have constrained the depositional age of <i>Homo naledi</i> to a period between 236 ka and 335 ka. These age results demonstrate that a morphologically primitive hominin, <i>Homo naledi,</i> survived into the later parts of the Pleistocene in Africa, and indicate a much younger age for the <i>Homo naledi</i> fossils than have previously been hypothesized based on their morphology.",

However, this was not the case with <i>Homo naledi</i>. More than 1500 fossils representing at least 15 individuals of this species were unearthed from the Rising Star cave system in South Africa between 2013 and 2014. Found deep underground in the Dinaledi Chamber, the <i>H. naledi</i> fossils are the largest collection of a single species of an ancient human-relative discovered in Africa.",

The material was undated, and predictions ranged from anywhere between 2 million years old and 100,000 years old. <i>H. naledi</i> shared several traits with the most primitive of our ancient relatives, including its small brain. As a result, many scientists guessed that <i>H. naledi</i> was an old species in our family tree, and possibly one of the earliest species to evolve in the genus <i>Homo</i>.",

These dates are based on measuring the concentration of radioactive elements, and the damage caused by these elements (which accumulates over time), in three fossilized teeth, plus surrounding rock and sediments from the cave chamber. Importantly, the most crucial tests were carried out at independent laboratories around the world, and the scientists conducted the tests without knowing the results of the other laboratories. Dirks et al. took these extra steps to make sure that the results obtained were reproducible and unbiased.",

These new findings demonstrate why it can be unwise to try to predict the age of a fossil based only on its appearance, and emphasize the importance of dating specimens via independent tests. Finally in two related reports, Berger et al. suggest how a primitive-looking species like <i>H. naledi</i> survived more recently than many would have predicted, while Hawks et al. describe the discovery of more <i>H. naledi</i> fossils from a separate chamber in the same cave system.",

The authors suggest that deposition of the hominin material was over a time period of about 100k between 200-300 ka. It does seem like the resolution and precision of the dates are not great and makes it difficult to properly interpret the context of the hominins. When the duration of deposition is considered, it then seems unusual that there would be so few hominins in the cave system, particularly if it is being used as a burial site (even if only for special individuals). Given the complexity of cave systems and their formation, I don't know that the authors have convincingly demonstrated that the chamber was completely inaccessible during the times of hominin deposition (especially with the wide range of dates and low resolution). That said, I sympathize with the inherent difficulties of dating fossils from cave systems and appreciate that the authors used multiple methods to try to pin down the dates and that this may be the best that can be done at this point.",

Each lithofacies represents an individual depositional event. Lithofacies may be grouped into lithofacies associations or assemblages, which are characteristic of particular depositional environments\". Thus, the basis of different subfacies here based on \"relative topographic position in the cave\" (i.e., facies 1c) is not valid criteria. Specifically, facies 1a is fine (non-lithified, horizontally laminated, orange mud). Facies 1b is fine (laminated mud with fine sand and rodent remains) and distinct from 1a. Facies 1c is \"similar in appearance and composition to the laminated, muddy sediments of facies 1a, but they occur \"in different places\". This is not a properly differentiated as a separate facies. Facies 1a in a different location in the cave topography is still facies 1a unless it can be differentiated appropriately. There are many examples in sed/strat where the same/similar facies are repeated multiple/different times in a succession. This is again an issue at the end of the paragraph where the facies differ in \"relative age and position within the cave chamber\", which is not a characteristic of facies.

For example, you could have formal Members A, B, C, D and then informal members E and F, but randomly throwing in informal members into this context is exceptionally odd. Ironically, the authors could subdivide Unit 3 into facies 3a and 3b as the presence/absence of fossils is a characteristic that can be used to differentiate facies. Also, what happens if they do ultimately find <i>H. naledi</i> fossils in the \"lower member\"? Something that would easily fix all of this is if they just used informal sub-units for all (e.g., 1a, 1b, 1c, 2, 3a, 3b), that way they can be consistent and define them as they wish as units have no formal definition while facies and member do.

Similarly, their assertion that facies 1c (as opposed to 1a or 1b) must have been the unit that provided the source material to Unit 2 (now 3?) is not confirmed by evidence and, again, is just a hypothesis. The authors are very definitive about their interpretation: \"it is <i>clear</i> that older laminated orange mud deposits ascribed to facies 1c in Unit 1 occurred above Unit 2 and <i>must have</i> provided the source material now found as much clasts within Unit 2\". As there are no dates for facies 1c, and as facies 1c is lithologically the same as 1a, this is a hypothesis, not an unquestionable fact. I have no problem if this is presented as a hypothesis: it might even be likely, but it is not definitive and I think the authors need to back away from such a claim. The authors note the challenges of OSL dating these deposits, yet rely almost exclusively on the OSL ages for a \"young\" facies 1a/b argument. An alternative explanation is that Unit 1a/b is older than Unit 2 and the OSL dates are incorrect (aliquots as opposed to single grain).

Each lithofacies represents an individual depositional event. Lithofacies may be grouped into lithofacies associations or assemblages, which are characteristic of particular depositional environments\". Thus, the basis of different subfacies here based on \"relative topographic position in the cave\" (i.e., facies 1c) is not valid criteria. Specifically, facies 1a is fine (non-lithified, horizontally laminated, orange mud). Facies 1b is fine (laminated mud with fine sand and rodent remains) and distinct from 1a. Facies 1c is \"similar in appearance and composition to the laminated, muddy sediments of facies 1a, but they occur \"in different places\". This is not a properly differentiated as a separate facies. Facies 1a in a different location in the cave topography is still facies 1a unless it can be differentiated appropriately. There are many examples in sed/strat where the same/similar facies are repeated multiple/different times in a succession. This is again an issue at the end of the paragraph where the facies differ in \"relative age and position within the cave chamber\", which is not a characteristic of facies.

Sediment of Facies 1c is consistently observed along chert ledges, and in solution pockets and fractures in the Dinaledi Chamber, and are interpreted to have originated as localised accumulations of muddy material that entered the chamber through thin (mm-scale) fracture networks.

For example, you could have formal Members A, B, C, D and then informal members E and F, but randomly throwing in informal members into this context is exceptionally odd. Ironically, the authors could subdivide Unit 3 into facies 3a and 3b as the presence/absence of fossils is a characteristic that can be used to differentiate facies. Also, what happens if they do ultimately find H. naledi fossils in the \"lower member\"?

The units are separated by erosional unconformities or flowstone intercalations, but do not all necessarily occur in direct contact with one another due to the complex nature of caves as depositional systems (e.g., <a href=\"#bib8\">Brain, 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib73\">Martini et al., 2003</a>). In addition, apart from sediments accumulating along the floor of the cave chamber, sediment in the form of orange mud deposits also accumulated inside fractures and along ledges higher up in the Dinaledi Chamber (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2b</a>), where it formed as a result of the combined effect of in situ weathering and deposition from water flowing down fractures and side walls. All units and sub-units are time-transgressive, meaning that they are lithostratigraphic units and not chronostratigraphic units that occur in strict temporal order. Periods of sedimentation alternated with periods of erosion, during which sediments were either redeposited or removed from the chamber via floor drains, resulting in erosional remnants of all units occurring in a variety of stratigraphic positions (<a href=\"#bib15\">Dirks et al., 2015</a>).",

In contrast, preliminary tests with U-Th disequilibrium dating at James Cook University (JCU) returned promising results. U-Th dating is more precise in the &lt;500 ka range than U-Pb dating, and is much less critically affected by detrital material. The initial tests with U-Th disequilibrium dating revealed that the fossils may be much younger than originally anticipated (e.g., <a href=\"#bib14\">Dembo et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib104\">Thackeray, 2016</a>), and mostly well within the range of the U-Th technique. Therefore, U-Pb dating was not pursued further.",

To obtain a lower age limit for sub-unit 3b, erosional remnants of Unit 1 sediments that were at least partially covered by fossil-bearing sub-unit 3b sediments, were sampled for OSL dating on the assumption that sub-units 1a and 1b in these areas are older than sub-unit 3b (<a href=\"#bib15\">Dirks et al., 2015</a>). This was done in the full knowledge that OSL dating of cave sediments is complex and difficult to interpret (e.g., <a href=\"#bib94\">Roberts et al., 2009</a>), and probably imprecise. As an internal control, we also sampled flowstones that cover the outcrops of sub-units 1a and 1b from which OSL samples were taken. These flowstones were dated with U-Th with the expectation that they are younger than the underlying Unit 1 sediments. In addition to OSL, Flowstone 1a, which overlies Unit 2 sediments, was sampled for palaeomagnetic analyses. This flowstone was targeted, because it was expected to be the oldest flowstone in the chamber and possibly older than 780 ka, and hence could potentially record reverse magnetic polarity (e.g., <a href=\"#bib98\">Singer, 2014</a>).

The next oldest age comes from a flowstone interpreted as Flowstone Group 1 overlying sediment of sub-unit 1b to the W of the excavation pit (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1b</a>) with an age of 290 ± 6 ka (RS5; <a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>). This age is younger than the OSL age derived from sub-unit 1a (OSL5), but is slightly older than OSL ages derived from sub-unit 1b in this location (OSL4; <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2c</a>). This suggests that sub-unit 1a was deposited prior to precipitation of this flowstone and that sub-unit 1b formed out of stratigraphic order due to erosion and redeposition of the top of sub-unit 1a beneath this flowstone. However, the U-Th date for RS5 should be interpreted with caution as the flowstone has a porous texture (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3a</a>), which probably indicates some degree of dissolution and/or recrystallization of the primary calcite, and may have affected the U-Th systematics (see Discussion).",

The final flowstone sample that was dated in this study was collected on the land surface above the cave system. It was sampled from a ~14 cm wide vertical flowstone-filled fracture exposed on the surface above the southern end of the Dinaledi Chamber itself. This is the only possible alternative entry-way into the Dinaledi Chamber that we have observed. The replicate samples (RS9) analysed at JCU and UoM both indicated secular equilibrium, which confirms that the flowstone sealed this fracture sometime before ~600 ka, eliminating this thin flowstone-filled fracture as a possible alternative entrance for <i>H. naledi</i> into the Dinaledi Chamber.

The ~ 50 ka flowstones originate from a W-trending fracture, 6 m W of the entry shaft where it overlies sub-unit 1a and sub-unit 3b sediments. The 24–32 ka flowstones all originate from around the area where the excavation pit is located at the intersection point of three fracture sets (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1b</a>). The youngest flowstone sample comes from below an active drip point, 1.5 m E of the excavation pit, and similar actively forming flowstones can be seen in other parts of the chamber.

As with ESR, significant Rn loss was detected in the samples of Unit 1, and corrections to the measured U concentrations were applied (<a href=\"#tbl8\">Table 8</a>).

However, in this study there are significant differences in the U-Th disequilibrium ages of teeth reported by the two laboratories (<a href=\"#tbl4\">Tables 4</a> and <a href=\"#tbl5\">5</a>). This difference in measured ages is most likely due to the fact that the different laboratories dated different fragments of the teeth. The U-Th analyses show that the U distribution within the teeth, and especially within enamel, is highly variable, as reflected in the wide range of U-Th ages (<a href=\"#tbl4\">Tables 4</a> and <a href=\"#tbl5\">5</a>). Where a tooth displays consistent ages and initial <sup>234</sup>U/<sup>238</sup>U ratios over a large domain, or where we have observed close coincidence in U-Th ages and initial <sup>234</sup>U/<sup>238</sup>U ratios for dentine and adjacent enamel samples, we interpret the results to suggest that a U uptake event has been dated. Considering the variable distribution of U within the tooth samples, it is possible that the same tooth records more than one U uptake event in different domains within the tooth (most notably when comparing enamel vs dentine domains; <a href=\"#bib35\">Grün et al., 2014</a>). Since Th is immobile, each U uptake event that affects the tooth will shift pre-existing U-Th systematics to portray a younger age (<a href=\"#bib35\">Grün et al., 2014</a>). The variable U-Th disequilibrium ages are a clear indication that U uptake events took place, and provide a minimum age estimate for the true age of the teeth. Where apparent ages are consistent across much of the tooth (e.g., sample 1767) they may approach the true age of the U uptake events. The results presented in this study show that the hominin teeth are clearly older than 70 ka, as evidenced from the consistent results on the dentine of samples 1788 and 1810. An important result from this method is the older closed system age (ca. 200 ka) from enamel obtained for sample 1810B by GU-ANU (<a href=\"#tbl5\">Table 5</a>). This result indicates that there was an early phase of U uptake in the tooth that was later overprinted in the associated dentine.

The reason why <sup>222</sup>Rn degassing occurs so readily probably relates to the crystallographic position occupied by U atoms.

It is, therefore, assumed that effective Rn degassing will have been an important process in the cave throughout the accumulation history of the Unit 3 sediments, although it seems unlikely that an extreme degassing environment similar to the 80% measured today was maintained during the entire history of burial. Therefore, we interpret the maximum US-ESR age estimates calculated for scenario 1 conditions to be the closest to the true age of the <i>H. naledi</i> fossils.

OSL analyses were carried out for aliquots of ~30 grains and each analysis, therefore, is an average of the signals contained in the grains. There is significant within-sample scatter in measured total dose (D<sub>e</sub>) values between different aliquots, meaning that age estimates are imprecise (uncertainties of 15–18%). Overdispersion in D<sub>e</sub> ranges from 50–70%, which is much higher than would be expected for a well-bleached sample (<a href=\"#bib28\">Galbraith et al., 1999</a>), and is a reflection of the cave environment from which the samples were taken (<a href=\"#bib22\">Duller, 2008</a>). We interpret this to mean that the quartz grains in each aliquot consist of a mixture of grains with some derived from outside the cave (and carried into the cave over a period of time), and others derived from quartz veins and chert beds within the cave that have only been partly bleached or have never been bleached at surface at all. Add to this the natural signal variability that can occur due to crystallographic orientation and lattice defects (<a href=\"#bib81\">Olley et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Galbraith et al., 1999</a>, <a href=\"#bib29\">2005</a>) and a large overdispersion results.

Thus, the MAM age is likely to provide a maximum age estimate for the Unit 1 sediments, and must be viewed with caution.

Flowstone 1a consists of at least three generations of flowstone growth, named, from oldest to youngest, phase A, B and C (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figures 2b</a>, <a href=\"#fig13\">13a,b</a> and <a href=\"#fig14\">14</a>). We dated phases B and C via U-Th, at 502 ka (RS23; <a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>) and 478 ka (RS22; <a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>) respectively, but the uncertainties are large because the ages are close to the upper dating limit of the U-Th technique. The oldest, phase A layer at the base of Flowstone 1a records reversed magnetic polarity indicating that it formed before 780 ka (<a href=\"#bib98\">Singer, 2014</a>). The three age estimates are consistent with the stratigraphic position of the three phases in Flowstone 1a, and they indicate that the erosion remnant of Unit 2 encrusted by Flowstone 1a is also older than 780 ka. The fact that the erosion remnants of Flowstone 1a dip into the chamber suggests that at the time of formation of all three phases of Flowstone 1a, the debris cone of Unit 2 sediment was still in place; that is, erosion of Unit 2 sediment from below Flowstone 1a would have occurred sometime after 585 ka (i.e., the older age limit for phase C in Flowstone 1a) and possibly as late as 437 ka (i.e., the younger age limit of phase C in Flowstone 1a). Unit 2 contains rare fossils of macrofauna, including a long bone in the erosion remnant, which must be older than 780 ka as well. We interpret the floor sediments of sub-unit 3a that contain the baboon tooth (sample 1841) to represent, at last in part, the reworked remains of the debris cone that once existed below Flowstone 1a (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>) as material was removed from the chamber via floor drains, thereby undercutting the debris cone, which responded by slowly slumping into the chamber – a process ongoing today. The baboon tooth could be part of the original, Unit 2 debris cone and, therefore, older than 780 ka, although the US-ESR age indicates that it could also be younger (with a mid point age of ~ 679 ka between a maximum age of 723 ± 181 ka and the minimum age of 635 ± 148 ka, with a possible age range of 487 ka to 904 ka). If the tooth is younger than 780 ka, it would suggest that it was derived from different sedimentary deposits not tested in this study, or that it may have entered the chamber separately during erosion of the Unit 2 debris cone, and its presence may reflect more direct entry points from surface into the chamber now sealed by flowstone. This possibility was tested with sample RS9, a flowstone sample filling a thin (&lt;14 cm wide) fracture in the dolomite on the surface that occurs above the Dinaledi Chamber. This flowstone yielded equilibrium U-Th results meaning that it formed before ~ 600 ka (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>), which is consistent with the interpretation that the Dinaledi Chamber was closed to direct entry of coarser-grained sediment from the surface prior to the entry of <i>H. naledi</i> into the cave system and remained closed until the present (<a href=\"#bib18\">Dirks et al., 2016a</a>).",

Cave carbonates less than ~ 600 ka in age can be precisely dated using the U-Th disequilibrium dating method (e.g., <a href=\"#bib49\">Hellstrom and Pickering, 2015</a>). The disequilibrium technique differs from other radiogenic techniques like U-Pb or Rb-Sr in which the daughter product is stable and accumulates indefinitely. In the <sup>238</sup>U decay chain, <sup>234</sup>U (half-life of 245.5 ka) decays to <sup>230</sup>Th (half-life of 75.4 ka), which itself decays to <sup>226</sup>Ra. This means that rather than accumulating indefinitely with time, the concentration of <sup>230</sup>Th in a sample gradually moves to a point where the number of decays of <sup>230</sup>Th atoms equals the number of <sup>230</sup>Th atoms produced via the decay of <sup>234</sup>U (‘secular equilibrium’). Because Th is nearly insoluble in surface waters, flowstone does not usually contain initial <sup>230</sup>Th, in contrast to U, which is soluble in oxidizing waters and is incorporated into flowstone at low concentrations (generally &lt;5 ppm; e.g., <a href=\"#bib89\">Pickering et al., 2010</a>). In U-Th dating, the accumulation of <sup>230</sup>Th towards secular equilibrium and the decay of its immediate parent (<sup>234</sup>U) yields the age. In calculating a U-Th age, the ratio of <sup>234</sup>U to its parent <sup>238</sup>U must also be determined, as this ratio is generally elevated above secular equilibrium in natural waters. The assumption that initial <sup>230</sup>Th concentrations in flowstone are close to zero may be violated by varying amounts of ‘detrital matter’, carrying initial <sup>230</sup>Th. However, many cave carbonates form with essentially no initial Th. Where corrections for initial Th are small, potential variability in the isotopic composition of this Th is generally incorporated in the age error. The U-Th dating technique has an upper age limit of ~600 ka, determined by the half-life of <sup>230</sup>Th, and by the precision with which the various isotopes can be measured in the laboratory (<a href=\"#bib12\">Cheng et al., 2013</a>).",

To evaluate this possible bias, we followed Method 3 described in <a href=\"#bib63\">Joannes-Boyau (2013)</a> for the extraction of the NOCOR’s from the main radiation-induced ESR signal (<a href=\"#fig12\">Figure 12</a>). When a fragment is rotated over 360°, the ESR intensity varies. The ratio of the maximum (I<sub>max</sub>) and minimum (I<sub>min</sub>) intensities (I<sub>max</sub>/I<sub>min</sub>) is used as a proxy to quantify the increased anisotropy potentially induced by either gamma or X-ray irradiations. The evolution of this ratio with the irradiation dose is shown in <a href=\"#fig12\">Figure 12</a>. When comparing the results from the two laboratories it is clear that both obtain similar results. For measurements conducted at CENIEH the I<sub>max</sub>/I<sub>min</sub> ratios for samples 1788 and 1810 remain near-constant (between 1.22–1.24) as the gamma dose varies. For measurements conducted at SCU the I<sub>max</sub>/I<sub>min</sub> ratios remain near-constant as well (and vary within uncertainty, between 1.6–2.0 for samples 1767, 1788 and 1810, and remain around 1.34 for sample 1841; <a href=\"#fig12\">Figure 12</a>) as the X-ray dose varies. The differences in the I<sub>max</sub>/I<sub>min</sub> ratios for each tooth calculated by the two laboratories results from the orientation chosen, the spatial variations of the ESR signal within the enamel layer, and the different crystal orientation and fragment position during ESR measurements. The fact that the results from both laboratories show constant ratios indicates that no additional NOCOR’s have been created by both gamma and X-ray irradiations.

This was done using an ASC Scientific non-magnetic saw with bronze saw blades to produce a total of six 2.5 by 2.5 cm subsample cores from the upper part of the flowstone; 3 from the uppermost 2.5 cm (phase C flowstone) and 3 from the lower 2.5 cm (phase B flowstone). Thinner samples could not be produced as the samples were weak. Only a small part of the lowest, clastic rich layer (phase A flowstone) was preserved on the base of the block sample (<a href=\"#fig13\">Figure 13a</a>) and this layer was cut into two 2 × 2 cm cubes for analysis.",
